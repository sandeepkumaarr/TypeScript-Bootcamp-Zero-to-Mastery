# TypeScript Bootcamp — Zero to Mastery (Study + Projects)

This repository documents my end-to-end learning journey through TypeScript — notes, exercises, experiments, and mini-projects.

## Why this repo exists
- Demonstrate TypeScript knowledge and problem-solving
- Show architecture thinking and trade-offs
- Provide verifiable evidence of hands-on learning

## What's inside
- 📘 `notes/` — concept notes with screenshots and diagrams
- 🧪 `exercises/` — exercises with Problem → Thought process → Solution
- 🚀 `mini-projects/` — project READMEs with architecture and learnings
- 🧪 `experiments/` — edge-case tests and compiler behavior
- 🧾 `cheatsheets/` — quick reference guides
- ✍️ `reflections/` — weekly retrospectives and lessons

## Tech Focus
TypeScript • Node.js • ES2023 • Clean Code • Design Patterns

## Status
✅ Active — updated as I complete modules and projects

## Next steps
1. Fill `notes/` with screenshots and explanations
2. Complete exercises with thought process and unit tests
3. Optionally publish docs with Docusaurus or MkDocs

If you'd like, I can scaffold the docs site (Docusaurus) next.
